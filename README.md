# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# The landing page was implemented according to this design:

# Implementation details

Throughout the project, I heavily relied on flexboxes, and ocassionally grid.

I utilized absolute / relative positioning to handle some of the design aspects in a more convenient and seamless way.

By declaring mixins for text, grid, padding, and such I facilitated the overall coding experience and avoided redundancy and repetitiveness.

I was trying to replace fixed values with the relative-to-the-screen-size ones to enhance the responsiveness and overall look across different devices.

Thanks to React, I was able to avoid re-writing the same HTML blocks, and used loops and arrays with data to handle things more smoothly.

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, and I'm looking forward to my next projects with React.js!
